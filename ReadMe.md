A brief description of your projectâ€™s purpose. Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance 
their current site by implementing a pet tracking database." Try to think of what would be useful to a potential 
employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
Instructions on any special requirements to run your project. If your project can be executed by opening the solution in 
Visual Studio and clicking Run, that is sufficient. If you require any configurations to your connection string, environment 
dependencies, or special instruction to run it, you must include details on how to do so.

# Staff Directory Project

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate some of the ASP.Net and C# knowledge I have gained thus far.
The project is a staff directory I made that is a CRUD application. This means that is will allow the user
to create,Read, Update, and Delete information. The information will be persistent through a SQL database.
I came up with the idea because the Accessibility Committee at the American Printing House for the Blind, 
where I currently work, is currently exploring options for a staff directory where internal users could
search for which employees have particular Accessibility skills they need help with.

## Notes
The EntryDetail.cshtml file is currently not implemented. The code for the "View" button in the 
Index.cshtml file that would call it has been commented out for now. I left it though because I 
plan on continuing to edit this past my time in Code Louisville.
