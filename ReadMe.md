A brief description of your projectâ€™s purpose. Example: "A website for my local animal shelter. I tried to enhance their current site by implementing a pet tracking database." Try to think of what would be useful to a potential employer that is looking at your GitHub account without any context or background about Code Louisville or your project.
Instructions on any special requirements to run your project. If your project can be executed by opening the solution in Visual Studio and clicking Run, that is sufficient. If you require any configurations to your connection string, environment dependencies, or special instruction to run it, you must include details on how to do so.
